# Description: 

The goal of this app is to allow user to create their own randomly generated password based on their criteria. 

# Usage 

When the user clicks the button "Click me to generate password" they are first promoted for password length. If outside the range of 8-50, the user is prompted to once again enter a password length within the acceptable range. The prompt will loop until the user enters a valid number. The program then prompts the user to define if they would like to include numbers, characters, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. If the user selects none to all criteria, the program will ask the user to select at least each one and will loop back through the prompts. Once all the parameters are selected then the password will show up inside the text box.
